A desktop environment usually consists of a window manager, a file manager, and programs and libraries for managing the desktop. The two most popular desktop environments are GNOME and KDE (K Desktop Environment). GNOME uses the GTK+ toolkit, and KDE uses Qt. GNOME and KDE also serve as an umbrella for a number of smaller projects (KDE programs often have names that start with the capital K).</p>

            <p class="Standard">A GNU/Linux system is able to run without the use of GUI programs (and even without X). The system provides a command line interface (CLI), from which the user can run command line programs. This kind of interface to the operating system is called a shell. The most common shell on Linux systems today is called the BASH shell. Most shells can also interpret scripts. These are simple unformatted text files in which a sequence of commands can be saved.</p>

            <p class="Standard">There are two ways to get access to a Bash shell. The simplest way is to open a terminal emulator from within the graphical environment. (on Ubuntu: applications, accessories, terminal). The other way is to switch to one of the so called virtual terminals. To do this, you type the key combination Ctrl+Alt+F1. This will get you out of the X window system, to the first virtual terminal. There are five more virtual terminals located at Ctrl+Alt+(F2-F6). Ctrl+Alt+F7 will get you back to X<span class="Footnoteanchor"><a href="#ftn1" id="bodyftn1">1</a></span>. You will have to login before you can use the virtual terminal (give your username and password).</p>

            <p class="Standard">A command can be entered by typing the name of the command at the Bash prompt, when you press 'Enter' the command will be executed (if the shell thinks it is valid). Commands can have options. These options can change the default behaviour of the program. Options can consist of a single letter or digit, preceded by a dash (e.g. "-o"). But often you can choose between short and long options. A long option is mostly preceded by two dashes (e.g. "--option"). Short options can be combined, with one dash ("-Xyz"). The shell uses whitespace (space, tab, newline) to distinguish between command, options and other arguments, just as we split sentences in words. So you should always separate commands and arguments at least with one space. Besides options, commands can take any number of other arguments (e.g. a filename)<span class="Footnoteanchor"><a href="#ftn2" id="bodyftn2">2</a></span>. You can look up all the options and arguments a command can take in the manual file of that command. </p>

            <p class="Standard">An important concept when working with a Linux System is the pathname. A pathname describes the location of a file or directory within the system. A pathname can be absolute, or relative. An absolute pathname describes the position of a file relative to the system root directory. The system root directory is represented by a simple slash (/). After the root slash, any number of subdirectories can be given, separated from each other with more slashes (e.g. /home/lieven/my_directory, /home/lieven/my_directory/my_file). You can recognize an absolute pathname, because it always starts with a slash. A relative pathname describes the location of a file or directory relative to your current working directory. The current working directory of your shell can be changed<span class="Footnoteanchor"><a href="#ftn3" id="bodyftn3">3</a></span>. So a relative pathname can mean different things to the system, depending on your position in the directory tree. A relative pathname never starts with a slash (e.g. my_dir/my_file), and the shell expands the pathname automatically into an absolute pathname (into e.g. /home/lieven/my_dir/my_file). When you open a new terminal, your current working directory will probably be your own home directory (/home/your_user_name). Every directory on a Linux system also contains two special directories: "." and ".." (dot, dot dot). They can be used in absolute, or relative pathnames<span class="Footnoteanchor"><a href="#ftn4" id="bodyftn4">4</a></span>. One dot refers to the directory in which it is contained, two dots refer to the parent directory of that directory.</p>

We will be using APT, as it is the default package manager on Debian based systems. APT provides a number of command line programs, which in turn are used by a number of GUI programs. The most popular graphical user interface to the APT system today is a program called "Synaptic". Â We will use it as the main tool to install packages in this course.</p>

These updates can be very small (e.g. bug fixes, security updates), but they can also change the system in more fundamental ways. To organize all these changes to the system, most distributions release a stable version of their system after a certain amount of time (every six months for Ubuntu). These releases can be marked by numbers (e.g. Fedora 9) or names (f.e Ubuntu Hardy Heron). After this, only minor changes to the system are allowed.</p>

Repositories are software archives which are accessible via the internet. APT has a configuration file ( /etc/apt/sources.list ) which determines what repositories APT can use. This file can be edited with a text editor, so you can add or remove repositories to the APT system<span class="Footnoteanchor"><a href="#ftn7" id="bodyftn7">1</a></span>. But you can also edit this file with a graphical user interface which is accessible from the Synaptic menu. The Ubuntu software repository is organized into four components: main (officially supported software), restricted (supported software that is not available under a completely free license), universe (community-maintained software, i.e. not officially supported), multiverse (software restricted by copyright or legal issues, not supported). The main and universe components are enabled by default on Ubuntu. If you want to add a new repository yourself, you should always make sure that it is meant for your specific release (in our case this is 'hardy').</p>

You will have to give your password to get access to the program. Now, you will see a list of all the packages that can be installed from the repositories. You can use the search button to search for a particular package. Every package also carries information about itself (meta data), e.g. its name, a short description, its dependencies (which other packages are needed for it to work), its version, etc. In the Find dialogue, you can enter a number of words, and in what metadata you want to search for those words. If you have found the package, you can right-click it, and select 'Mark for Installation' from the pop-up menu. In the S (status) column of the package, you will see a small square which will now be marked with a little arrow. If the package depends on other packages which are not yet installed, Synaptic will show you the names of these packages, and ask you if you want to mark these as well. You can choose to mark them, or you can cancel the whole operation. You can go on, and mark as many packages as you want. When you are ready, you press the 'Apply' button. Now Synaptic will show you all the changes you have asked for, and you have one last chance to cancel the installation. When you press apply again, Synaptic will download and install the packages automatically. The little square in the status column will be marked green when the package is installed. To remove a package, right-click on an installed package, and click 'Mark for Removal' or 'Mark for Complete Removal'. The difference is that 'Complete Removal' will remove the configuration files of that package as well (If you plan to reinstall a package, it can be handy to keep your customized configuration files on the system). When you are done with marking the packages, you apply the changes as described above. When packages have been updated to a newer version in a repository, the packages will be automatically marked as 'upgradable'. The little square in the status column will show a little star inside. You can always press the 'Mark All Upgrades' button, and then 'Apply' to install all upgradable packages.

When you have downloaded the package you can just double click on it. Ubuntu will open the GDebi Package Installer which makes installing the package very easy. You should always make sure the package is suitable for your system. Because Debian and Ubuntu share the same base system, you will often be able to install a package made for debian on an Ubuntu system, or the other way round. But this will not always work, and it is better to avoid mixing packages from different systems. You will almost always find the same package for your specific version of Ubuntu. Because GDebi uses the APT system as well, your package will be recognized as any other package on your system</span>

            <p class="cursusparagraph">A lot of programs and libraries for Linux are written in C or C++. Initially the program consists of text files which can be read and edited with a text editor. In a second step these files can be compiled with a compiler. On linux this will probably be the GNU C compiler (gcc or g++). The compiler will transform the text files into binary code, which can be executed on your system (You could say that the human language is converted into computer language). When everything is compiled and ready, the different pieces of the program or library can be installed on your system.</p>

            <p class="cursusparagraph">Source packages are often distributed in the form of a tar archive. A tar archive is actually a collection of files that are stored as one file with the .tar extension. The archive can be created or extracted with the <span style="font-weight:bold">tar</span> utility. The name "tar" is derived from "tape archive" as tar was historically used to make backups to tape drives. A tar archive does not use file compression techniques to make the file smaller. That's why tar archives are usually compressed with the standard linux compression tools: gzip (extension .gz) and bzip2 (extension .bz2). As a result, source packages often have two extensions (e.g. archive.tar.gz), and they are often called tarballs. Modern versions of tar will uncompress the tarball automatically for you. The typical command to uncompress and extract a tarball is: 'tar -xvf archive.tar.gz' . The "-x" option tells tar to extract, "-v" tells tar to be verbose (show the files that are extracted), "-f" tells tar that it has to extract from a file.<br /></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class="cursusparagraph">When you have extracted the tarball, a new directory will be made, with the contents of the archive. Now we can start building the program. First you would normally 'cd' into the directory, and read the README and INSTALL files. These files often contain information about the dependencies of the program, instructions to build or install the program, etc. We can install the needed dependencies with Synaptic. But we have to make sure that for every dependency, we have the corresponding development package installed as well. These packages have the same name as the original package, but with the "-dev" postfix. They are only necessary when you want to compile programs from source.<br />The first command we have to give is <span style="font-weight:bold">./configure</span>. This script is provided by the source package, and it checks what building tools we use on our system, if the necessary dependencies are installed, and a lot more. It is very likely that it will return an error because something is missing on your system. Just have a look at the error, and install the necessary package. You have to repeat this process until the './configure' command succeeds<span class="Footnoteanchor"><a href="#ftn10" id="bodyftn10">1</a></span>. Now we can type <span style="font-weight:bold">make</span> in the terminal. The 'make' command will build everything needed for the package. This might take a while, depending on how large the program is. Now we are ready to install the necessary components on our system. Source packages should install their files in the '/usr/local/' hierarchy by default. You will need root privileges to do the installation. To install, we type <span style="font-weight:bold">sudo make install</span> in the terminal. The executables will now be installed in the '/usr/local/bin' directory, and you can now use them as any other command. <span style="font-weight:normal">Â </span></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class="cursusparagraph">One of the difficulties with installed source packages, is that it is not so easy to uninstall them. Sometimes you will be able to issue <span style="font-weight:bold">sudo make uninstall</span><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal"> from within the source package directory</span><span style="font-weight:normal">. But this will not always be the case. And once the files are installed in the '/usr/local' hierarchy, it is very hard to know which files belongs to which package. <br />That is why I would like to introduce you to the 'Stow' system. The idea is that we install every package we build from source into it's own subdirectory in the '/usr/local/stow' directory. When this is done, we can use the </span><span style="font-weight:bold">stow</span><span style="font-weight:normal"> command to make links in the '/usr/local' hierarchy for every file in that subdirectory. Now our system will recognize the programs and libraries we installed. When we want to delete a package, we can use 'stow' again to delete all the links for that package in the '/usr/local' hierarchy. And we can start from a clean slate again. Stow makes it also very easy to have multiple versions of a package installed. You can install them next to each other in the '/usr/local/stow' directory. The system won't know about them until you make the necessary links with stow. To use a newer version of a program, you delete the links to the older version, and make new ones to the new version. Completely deleting a package from you system is very simple as well. Just delete the links with the 'stow' command, and remove the directory of that program.<br /></span></p>
